## 3 types of simulators


### Game Of life


The Game of Life simulator processes black and white pixelated images. The window size, cell count, and size remain constant. Users can choose between continuous or step-by-step simulation. Real-time cell addition, picture changes, resizing, and other features enhance the gaming experience.

### Sand Simulator


In the Sand Simulator, black and white pixelated images form the sand map. The simulation allows gravitational sandfall and sand sliding. Users can dynamically add or remove sand grains, change simulation type, resize cells, and more.

### Road Traffic Simulator


The Road Traffic Simulator visualizes traffic flow with intersections and traffic lights. Users control the traffic density, and the simulation can be continuous or step-by-step. The simulator includes features like clearing the road, changing density, and returning to the main menu.
